# StateSim: Monte Carlo simulation of international state systems

Python simulation of war and diplomacy. Begins with initialization:

* Phase I: Initialize data and build world

Proceeds in _n_ iterations, each in three phases:

* Phase II: Diplomacy
* Phase III: War (potentially)
* Phase IV: Power adjustment

This project is heavily inspired by some literature developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, by Richard J. Stoll, Thomas R. Cusack, and a few others. Their work was in turn based on an even older computer simulation due to Bremer and Mihakla (1977). Cusack (1990) contains an overview of the research program.
