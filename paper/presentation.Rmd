## Introduction

- Computer simulation of state systems to examine hypotheses from the realist school of international relations theory

  * What factors are conducive to the stability of a state system?
  * What factors improve the survival chances of an individual state?

- Original simulation: Cusack and Stoll (1990)

- Parameters are varied over 1594 runs of the simulation, and results are subjected to survival analysis



## Introduction: Outline

- What is a 'state'? What is a 'state system'?

- Hypotheses to be tested

- Outline of the simulation

- Statistical analysis

- Concluding remarks



## What is a state system?

States:

- A singular entity that controls a body of territory and the associated resources and population
- Has a monopoly of force within this territory
- No authority greater than it, i.e., exists in anarchy
- 'Legally' equal to the other states
- Tries to reproduce itself by adhering to its circumscribed reason
  * Depending on the theorist: Maximizes security or maximizes power


## What is a state system?

State system:

- A collection of states and their relationships with eachother
- The _de jure_ and _de facto_ rules of conduct between them
- The distribution of power among them



## Example: Ancient Greek state system

- Urban settlements begin the 8th century BCE




## Example: Ancient Greek state system, 700 BCE

Composed of 24 states

![Ancient Greek state system c. 700 BCE](./img/greece_700.png)




## Example: Ancient Greek state system, 430 BCE

Peaks at 40 states, just as the Peloponnesian War starts between Athens and Sparta (431--405)

```{r fig.cap='Ancient Greek state system c. 430 BCE', fig.height=2.5, echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/greece_430_2.png'))
```

<!-- ![Ancient Greek state system c. 430 B.C.](./img/greece_430_2.png) -->



## Example: Ancient Greek state system, 338 BCE

Universal empire---Macedonia under Philip seizes all of Greece. His son, Alexander the Great, takes them to war against the Persian Empire

```{r fig.cap='Ancient Greek state system c. 338 BCE', fig.height=2.25, echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/greece_338.png'))
```



## Example: Ancient Greek state system and universal empire

- The final outcome of the Ancient Greek state system was universal empire

- This dynamic repeats itselfs in state systems across the world, across history

- What accounts for this?



## Hypotheses

Without going in the literature of international relations theory---this simulation explicitly models the following, and seeks to determine their effect on state stability and survival:

1. Degree of inequality in power in the system
2. Evenness of economic growth between the states
3. The presence of norms of restraint, modeled as reparations paid by a war's loser to the victor
4. Accuracy of state's perception of their and other states' power
5. Destructiveness of warfare
6. Distribution of costs of war between losers and victors



## Hypotheses: Realism

- Within the realist school of international relations, different theoriests propose contradictory answers for each of the hypotheses above

- Despite pledging fidelity to the same (?) body of theory!

  * The simulation thus functions primarily as a test of _internal consistency_, ruling out theories that contradict themselves
  
  
  
## The Simulation

- I'm going to focus on the mathematical part of the simulation, and breeze over more technical aspects



## The Simulation: Entities

There are two central object classes to this simulation:

1. `State`, representing individual states
2. `System`, representing the 'world'



## The Simulation: Phases

* Phase 0: Initialize the world

The next phases repeat themselves over 1000 iterations

* Phase 1: Select a 'protagonist' state
* Phase 2: Diplomacy
* Phase 3: War (potentially)
* Phase 4: Power adjustment, economic growth



## Simulation: Phase 0: Initialize the world

States represented as nodes in a random regular graph network ($n=98$, $p=8$), where the edges are the borders

```{r fig.height=2, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/random_regular.png'))
```



## Simulation: Phase 0: Initialize the world

- Each of the 98 states are assigned a power resource randomly from a normal distribution with $\mu = 10$

- Standard deviation is a parameter in the model



## Simulation: Phase 1: Protagonist state

- One state is randomly selected as the 'protagonist' of the turn

- The probability of selection is proportional to their power within the system



## Simulation: Phase 2: Diplomacy

- The protagonist state examines all the states it borders, tries to find the one it has the most power over

- States do not accurately estimate eachother's power, but according to the equation:

$$ E_i(p_{j})  = p_j \times (1 + randnorm(0, \sigma_{perception})) $$

where $\sigma_{perception}$ is a simulation parameter



## Simulation: Phase 2: Diplomacy

- If the protagonist feels sure they are more powerful than the target state, a series of diplomacy occurs

- The target state tries to get allies to ward off the protagonist state

- The protagonist state builds its own alliances in turn



## Simulation: Phase 2: Diplomacy

- State alliance behavior is very naive: A state only agrees to become an ally if it considers it to be on the winning side

- State's accept or reject alliances independently of other states' decisions

- When given an alliance proposal, a state assesses the power of the proposed alliance with $\sigma_{perception}$ as above



## Simulation: Phase 3: War

- The protagonist state has three chances to back down and avoid war over the period of this alliance building

- If it does not back down, war ensues



## Simulation: Phase 3: Who wins a war?

- The key variable is the _power differential_ between two states or alliances

- However, we want to leave room for other factors, including random chance

- The simulation parametizes this as $\sigma_{victory}$



## Simulation: Phase 3: Who wins a war?

- Likelihood of victory ($LV$) is modeled as a logistic curve, where steepness is controlled by the parameter $\sigma_{victory}$

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.5, fig.cap='sigma_{victory} = (1, 2, 4) for black, red, and blue, respectively.'}
LV <- function(x, sigma) 1 / (1 + exp(-x*sigma))

plot(seq(-3, 3, .1), LV(seq(-3, 3, .1), 1), type='l', ylim=c(0,1),
     xlab='Power differential', ylab='Likelihood of victory', main='Likelihoods of victory')
lines(seq(-3, 3, .1), LV(seq(-3, 3, .1), 2), col='red')
lines(seq(-3, 3, .1), LV(seq(-3, 3, .1), 4), col='blue')
rect(-3.24, -0.15, 0, .5, lty=2)
```



## Simulation: Phase 3: Who wins a war?

- Thus $LV$ is the area beneath one of these curves, between negative infinity and the power differently $ln(p_i/p_j)$

$$ LV_{ij} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \sigma}} \int_{ -\infty }^{ ~ ln(p_i/p_j) } e^{-(x / \sigma)^2} ~ dx $$



## Simulation: Phase 3: Costs of war

- Both sides must incur a cost

- The losing side should incur a higher cost

- Costs are proportional to power differential

  * War between evenly matched states is the most destructive
  
  
  
## Simulation: Phase 3: Costs of war

- First, the 'base' cost of the war:

$$C_i = \left( 1 - \frac{LSR - 0.5}{0.5} \right) \times C_{max}$$

- where $LSR$ is a ratio of the stronger side's power to the weaker side's power:

$$LSR = \frac{ max(p_i, p_j) }{p_i + p_j}$$

- and $C_max$ is a parameter controlling the max cost of war



## Simulation: Phase 3: Costs of war

- Second, the winner/loser modifier:

$$C_{stronger} = C_i - \left( min( randnorm(0, 1) \times C_{max}, C_{disparity} \right))$$

$$C_{weaker} = C_i + \left( min( randnorm(0, 1) \times C_{max}, C_{disparity} \right))$$

- where $C_disp$ is the disparity parameter




## Simulation: Phase 3: Spoils of war

- A portion of the losing alliance's remaining power is transferred to the winning coalition

$$S = reparations \times p_j$$

- where $reparations$ is a parameter controling the reparations weight



## Simulation: Phase 3: The Versailles rule

- The leader of the losing state transfers a percentage of their power to the winning side equal to $LSR$

- Termed the 'Versailles' rule, it can be quite onerous

- Is a parameter in the simulation

- This is done to maintain compatibility with the original Cusack and Stoller simulation



## Simulation: Phase 4: Power adjustment

- States' economic growth is pulled randomly each turn from a Cauchey distribution with mean and standard deviation as model parameters

- Stoll and Cusack originally used a normal distribution, which results in exponential growth; economic depressions are more frequent than predicted by a normal distribution



## Simulation: Phase 4: Power adjustment

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=5.5, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Cauchey (red) distributions has a thicker tails than the normal distribution (black).'}
set.seed(1804)
x <- seq(-10, 10, by=0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x), type='l', ylab='Density', main='Normal and Cauchey PDFs')
lines(x, dcauchy(x), col='red')
```



## Statistical analysis

- Survival analysis: Let $\mathbf{X}$ represent the parameters of specific simulations

- Modeling formula for state systems as the unit of analysis:

$$\textup{Turns to universal empire} \sim \mathbf{X}$$

- Modeling formula for individual states and their survival time:

$$\textup{Turns to state elimination} \sim \mathbf{X}$$



## Survival analysis

- Not the main focus of this presention so I won't go into in depth

- Models _time to event_ as the dependent variable (e.g., death, customer churn)

- I use parameteric survival analysis, modeling state and system survival as an exponential curve
  * Tried to use nonparametric Cox Proportional Hazards model, did not work out well
  
  
  
## Statisical analysis: State survival estimated coefficients

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/state_coef.png'))
```



##  Statisical analysis: Interpretation

- Standard errors that cross 1 indicate not significantly different than 0

- >1 means increasing variable _decreases_ survival time, i.e., negative relationship

- <1 means increasing variable _increases_ survival time, i.e., positive relationship



## Statistical analysis: Effect of the Versailles rule

Median state survival time:

* Versailles=FALSE: 222 turns
* Versailles=TRUE: 116 turns

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/versailles.png'))
```



##  Statisical analysis: Validation

- Plot the (parametric) model's hazard rate against non-parametric Kaplan-Meier curve

- Agreement indicates good model fit

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/m_state.png'))
```





## Statisical analysis: System survival estimated coefficients

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/sys_coef.png'))
```



##  Statisical analysis: Validation

- As obvious from the wide confidence intervals, not a great fit

- Interestingly, the authors of the original simulation were unable to get a good fit for their own model of state survival using Tobit regression

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
grid.raster(readPNG('./img/m_system.png'))
```



## Conclusion

- Without going into international relations theory:

  * Simulation has shown that even under very simple assumptions about state behavior, the effects of economic growth, norms of restraint, misperception, etc., have a very real effect on system stability and state survival
  
  * _Contra_ the 'automatic stabilization thesis' which suggests none of these should matter

  * Simulation implies such theories suffer from logical inconsistency
